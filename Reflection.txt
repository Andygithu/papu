Please take a few minutes to reflect on your experience in CSE 111 and
think about the challenges, successes, and all that you've learned
along the way.


Now, please respond thoroughly (1 - 2 paragraphs for each question) to
the following questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
I did see the power of functions during the whole course because I did write more complex
the program than I did in CSE 110 and programming with functions helped me to visualize more
clear what I want to do and accomplish that by dividing the tasks of a program into parts
I saw that especially when I did my final project because I had the opportunity to reuse my functions
to make the same task inside of my program and that helped me to be more efficient.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
It's an important resource that has helped me to verify if a program is working correctly and It gives the
expected result that I want and I think it's a way to know if I should change or fix something I had one experience
this semester when I was testing my program I was frustrated because I thought the test function is wrong and my code is right so why is not passing
the test but then I did realize where the problem was and the test passed so I did learn the importance to pay attention to the test programs
because It gives us a clue of where the problem may be.



3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
To be honest most of the time I try to find and fix a problem by printing out the results many times until I get the
the result that I want and I know that is not the best practice so I want to improve my troubleshooting process by using the debugger in visual studio
code and use the test functions to help find errors and to make sure that my program is working correctly.
